## I'm Gareth

I'm a developer with interests in building fullstack web applications, blockchain, game dev, 3d programming, and the creative experience of technology. I've been working in the financial services for 4 years, building large scale, low latency trading systems and applications.

ðŸŒ± I'm currently focused on learning blockchain and writing smart contracts in Solidity. 

You can check [out my website](https://garethv.xyz/) where you can get in contact with me or [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/gareth_xyz/), where I actively share what I'm working on.
